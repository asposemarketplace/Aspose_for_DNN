<h2>DNN Exchange Sync &ndash; 2 Way Link between DNN Users and Microsoft Exchange Server Contacts</h2>
<div>
<p>DNN Exchange Sync is an open source module from <a href="http://www.aspose.com/"> Aspose</a> that links your DNN users to Microsoft Exchange Server contacts without requiring any other software. It uses powerful features of <a href="http://www.aspose.com/.net/email-component.aspx">Aspose.Email for .NET</a> to allow you to easily sync your Exchange contacts and DNN users. The contact details from Exchange server and DNN user profile are smartly mapped so that all the information associated with a DNN user or Exchange contact is migrated properly from one system to the other.</p>
